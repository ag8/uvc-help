## Help us download structures for our UVC project!

1. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed (tested on 114.0.5735.198)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python chemscrape_based.py [number]`, where [number] is your assigned download offset (see below)
4. Send the downloaded `.mol` files, as well as `errors.txt`, to hello@cavendishlabs.org

Thank you!!
